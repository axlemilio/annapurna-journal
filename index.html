<h2>When It Hit Me</h2>
<p>The moment we landed in Kathmandu, I realized: Sht, this is real.*</p>
<p>Not the cold — that came later. It was the smell first. A mix of incense, diesel, and sunlight bouncing off brass temple roofs. Prayer flags snapping in the wind like impatient thoughts. Jakob and Aurora went quiet — that wide-eyed kind of quiet na only happens when the world suddenly feels bigger than you thought.</p>
<p>I told them, “This is the roof of the world. Breathe it in.”</p>
<p>Sabi ko rin sa sarili ko. Kasi honestly, I needed this trip as much as they did.</p>

<h2>Why We Were Here</h2>
<p>This wasn’t about checking boxes sa passport. I wanted them — and me — to remember what wonder feels like when you earn it. Hindi yung instant, hindi yung click sa phone. The kind that comes from walking ‘til your legs complain, from saying Namaste to the same stranger twice kasi kilala mo na siya.</p>
<p>We came for the mountains. Pero maybe… also for a quieter version of ourselves.</p>

<h2>Kathmandu — Noise + Grace</h2>
<p>Patan and Durbar Square felt alive — not a museum. History here sells you spices and points you to tea.</p>
<p>At Swayambhunath, the Monkey Temple, prayer wheels spun like little turbines of prayer. Jakob counted the steps. Aurora haggled for bracelets — and won. A woman at a shrine taught us to bow, palms together. The lesson wasn’t religion — it was respect.</p>
<p>Sunset sa rooftop café: Gold light. Dust in the air. The hum of the city below. For once, tahimik kaming lahat.</p>

<h2>Pokhara — The Calm Before</h2>
<p>Pokhara is a lake cupped in quiet hands. In the morning, Machapuchare — the Fishtail — floats in the clouds like it’s deciding whether to show itself.</p>
<p>We sat with guides talking about treks: Poon Hill, Mohare Danda, Mardi Himal. My brain was doing dad-calculus — altitude, weather, gear, safety. The kids were joking about yaks. Ako, I was checking the sky, imagining backup plans.</p>

<h2>Astam — Where the Mountains Kept Us</h2>
<p>We took a jeep up winding roads to Annapurna Eco-Village. Air got cleaner. Views got bigger. Evenings: fire and stars. Mornings: rice terraces stepping into forever.</p>
<p>Plan was to trek from here. Pero life — and the mountains — had other ideas. Jakob got sick. Then Aurora. Nothing major, just the kind of travel flu na humbles your itinerary.</p>
<p>So we slowed down. Short walks instead of long climbs. Tea instead of checkpoints. Aurora learned a dance from village kids. Jakob insisted on carrying his own pack to breakfast. I let him. He found his edge. So did I.</p>

<h2>The Trek We Didn’t Take</h2>
<p>We could’ve gone for Poon Hill’s famous sunrise. Or Mardi Himal’s ridge. But the point was never to punish ourselves. The point was presence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terraces where lolas carried more weight than any of us.</li>
<li>Hanging bridges where the kids turned into circus acrobats.</li>
<li>A schoolyard where a boy asked Jakob about the NBA, then laughed when they realized pareho silang sablay sa basketball.</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned adventure isn’t always vertical. Sometimes, it’s a posture.</p>

<h2>What the Mountains Said</h2>
<ul>
<li>Plans are fine. Pero presence is better.</li>
<li>You can measure a trip in kilometers or kindness — one matters more.</li>
<li>You came here to climb a mountain. You built a family memory instead. That’s a win.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Small Scenes I’ll Keep</h2>
<ul>
<li>A woman in Patan blessing our foreheads, then morning traffic swallowing us whole.</li>
<li>Aurora’s dance with two giggling sisters — half-wrong, fully perfect.</li>
<li>Jakob and I by the fire, barely talking, wood cracking like punctuation.</li>
<li>Clouds sliding across Machapuchare, making us all shut up without planning to.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If You Go</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gear: Warmth + rain protection. Walang negotiation dito, lalo na with kids.</li>
<li>Routes: Poon Hill = social. Mardi Himal = quieter, steeper. Mohare Danda = in-between.</li>
<li>Altitude: Slow is fast. Cut a day if needed. Add chai if you can.</li>
<li>Astam Eco-Village: When you need to downshift. Short walks. Big views. Real people.</li>
<li>Backup Plans: Have two. The mountain gets a vote.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gratitude</h2>
<p>To the guides na walang pressure, only patience.</p>
<p>To the villagers who gave space for our clumsy Nepali.</p>
<p>To my kids, who turned detours into destinations.</p>

<h2>Ending Where We Began</h2>
<p>In Kathmandu, prayer wheels spin because someone decides to spin them. Faith isn’t automatic — it’s practiced. Same with family.</p>
<p>We didn’t conquer anything in Nepal. We listened. We adjusted. We chose each other. If you measure a trip by peak altitude, we failed. If you measure by what stays, we stood higher than any viewpoint.</p>
<p>Next time, we’ll chase the ridge. This time, the village kept us. And I’m grateful it did.</p>
